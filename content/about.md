Hi, I’m Leander, an engineer based in Munich. I enjoy reverse engineering complex systems, whether they're web architectures, RF signals, or Embedded, with the curiosity of a white hat hacker.

By day, I’m a Senior Software Engineer at FINN one of Germany’s most exciting startups. I lead cross-department projects, dive deep into architecture, clean up legacy chaos, and build the things that don’t exist yet. I care a lot about ownership and don’t wait around when something needs fixing or pushing forward.

I’ve got a soft spot for 35mm photography, heavy techno, clean Git histories, and making things that feel sharp, fast, and intentional. This site is where I drop ideas, notes, and whatever else feels worth writing down.
