I enjoy reverse engineering complex systems, whether they&amp;rsquo;re web architectures, RF signals, or Embedded, with the curiosity of a white hat hacker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By day, I’m a Senior Software Engineer at FINN one of Germany’s most exciting startups. I lead cross-department projects, dive deep into architecture, clean up legacy chaos, and build the things that don’t exist yet. I care a lot about ownership and don’t wait around when something needs fixing or pushing forward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
